// If we want to install any specific version of the dependency, 
// we can easily do that. For example, if want to install version 1.3.5 of 
// slugify, we have to write as npm install slugify@1.3.5.



// Let us now see what dev dependencies are. There are times when
//  we want to install the packages only for development purposes,
//   not for production purposes. In that case, dev dependencies are useful. 
//   The best example of this is nodemon. It gives us the server which 
//   automatically gets restart every time. 

// To install this, we have to write-

// npm intall nodemon --save-dev
